<h1>RobustEMD: Domain Robust Matching for Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation</h1>

## Abstaract

Few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) aims to perform the limited annotated data learning in the medical image analysis scope. Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes.
